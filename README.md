<h3>Do my Canvas quiz</h3> 
<p>I am taking a online GE course and I just cannot be bother do every quizs manually..</p>
<h3>Framework: Selenium</h3>
<h3>Have to download the right version of Chrome browser: http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html</h3>
<p>This script will automaticity do the Canvas quiz, it will always select the last answers in the beginning and store the "correct answers" into a text file after every submission and check if any answers appear in the text file before the next submission so that the grade will improve.</p> 

<p>Better use it in those ultimate attempt quiz, and the only problem now is sometimes there will be multiple same answers in many questions, which can be solved by storing the right question/answer into a pair like hashtable (still working on that)</p>
